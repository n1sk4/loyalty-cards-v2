Loyalty cards
====================================
About
-----
This app was developed as a starting point of mine Master thesis at Polytechnic of Zagreb.
The app that stores loyalty card data came as an idea when my wife told me that she has too many
loyalty cards to fit in her wallet or even bag...

Loyalty cards application, allows users to add, remove and update Loyalty cards.
Having that in mind, you can add/change:
 * Store name
 * Barcode number
 * Store logo

Another feature is using Google Vision to scan the barcodes for the ease of entering Barcodes.
The app allows scanning of 1D or 2D barcodes, and the user can select the type based on preference,
or you can enter the barcode by yourself.

App's logo can also be set as the user wishes, selected from gallery or by taking a picture.

Data storage
--------------
This app uses SQLite database, in which the Stores are saved. 
The database is stored in local data repository of the device, so the app is autonomous of the Internet.
Database is consisted of four columns:
 * Id - integer
 * Store name - string
 * Store barcode - string
 * Store logo - blob (Bitmap)

App accesses the data by the uid and then uses the name as-is,
barcode is generated in the runtime,
while the logo is generated from BLOB to Bitmap in the runtime.

Home screen
-----------
Opening the app the first time will direct you to the MainActivity which contains:
 * Recycler View
 * Floating Action Button
 * Menu

Recycler view is populated in the runtime, with the data from the SQLite databse.
Each item from the recyler view is a custom card layout that contains the store name and logo.
If the database is empty, home screen shows an icon and text displaying that You don't have any
Loyalty cards stored in the database.
The menu contains only one option: delete all data, which will empty out the database and reset the uid index.

When a few stores had been added, You can click and drag the stores to change the order in which they are placed,
so you can have more frequently used cards on top of the list.
